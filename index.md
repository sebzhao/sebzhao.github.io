# About Me

Hi! I'm Sebastian Zhao, a ml researcher. I'm currently doing research in [pallas](https://github.com/SqueezeAILab) working with Coleman Hooper under Professor Kurt Keutzer. I like cooking, creating plated desserts, thrifting, playing guitar, and skateboarding.

## Research Interest

I'm broadly interested in efficient ML.  My recent work has been on model compression and long context inference. I'm particularly interested in optimizing across models, systems, and hardware with the goal of democratizing ML! I've previously worked on coding assistants, robotics, and AI ethics.
