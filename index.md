# About Me

Hi! I'm Sebastian Zhao, an undergraduate senior at Berkeley studying CS/DS. I'm currently doing research in [pallas](https://github.com/SqueezeAILab) working with Coleman Hooper and Sehoon Kim.

## Research Interest

I'm broadly interested in efficient ML.  My recent work has been on model compression and long context inference. I'm particularly interested in optimizing across models, systems, and hardware with the goal of democratizing ML!
